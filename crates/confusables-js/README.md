# confusables-js

> **Note**: This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

I decided to not publish this anywhere because it seems that publishing pre-compiled binaries on
NPM is quite the hassle (at least compared to python) and stuff generally just did not work for me
at all ðŸ—¿
