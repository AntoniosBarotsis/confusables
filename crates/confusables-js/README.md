# confusables-js

> **Note**: This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

I decided to not publish this anywhere because it seems that publishing pre-compiled binaries on
NPM is quite the hassle (at least compared to python) and stuff generally just did not work for me
at all ðŸ—¿

## Installing confusables-js

Installing confusables-js requires a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

You can install the project with npm. In the project directory, run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

This will generate an `index.node` (~ `379.9KB`) file which you can import with `require('.')` if
you are in the same directory.
